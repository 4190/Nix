Before starting- use update-database in NuGet Package Console to setup a database locally

Future ideas- 
-Split the app to at least 2 microservices, one responsible for link generating, the other responsible for redirections. Create API endpoints.
-Separate React frontend using axios to connect with API endpoints and use the app.
