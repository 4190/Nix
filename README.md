# Nix

Before starting- use update-database in NuGet Package Console to setup a database locally

Future ideas- 
-Split the app to at least 2 microservices, one responsible for link generating, the other responsible for redirections. Create API endpoints. Each microservice split in layer projects e.g. Shortener.API, Shortener.Data, Shortener.Domain
-Separate React frontend using axios to connect with API endpoints and use the app.
-Contenerize each sln and React app separately
